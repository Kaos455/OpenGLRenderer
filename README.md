# OpenGL Renderer

## Overview

**OpenGL Renderer** is a simple 3D renderer that uses OpenGL for rendering. It is written in C++ and uses the [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) library for window management and the [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) library for loading OpenGL functions.
Following the OpenGL tutorial [here](https://learnopengl.com/).
